When user enter a URL into the browser the browser will check the cache for a DNS record to find the matching IP address. If the DNS record is not in the browser cache from any previously visited sites it goes to the OS cache, if not then it checks for the router cache, and lastly ISP cache. Once the browser know which IP address associated with the URL, it will build a connection with the server through process called three-way handshake. During connection the browser send request by using GET request to web server. The web server which usually contains a virtual host will use handler to handle the request by checking secure requirement then generate the response and send back to browser when it done. The response usually include status of the response, other data and HTML content to browser. When the browser receives the response it will display HTML content on screen.
